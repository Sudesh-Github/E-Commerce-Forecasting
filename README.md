# E-Commerce Marketing Budget Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the marketing budget of an e-commerce firm specializing in electronic products based in Ontario, Canada. The company has made significant investments in various marketing channels over the past year, including promotions and advertising. The challenge is to analyze the marketing spend and determine how to either streamline the budget or strategically reallocate it across different marketing levers to enhance revenue growth.

## Problem Statement

The company's CFO has raised concerns about the return on investment (ROI) of the current marketing efforts, believing that the impact of marketing spend has not been as effective as anticipated. Our goal is to provide insights on optimizing the marketing budget by identifying opportunities for either budget reduction or reallocating funds to more effective marketing channels to maximize revenue response.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Cleansing**: Preprocessing and cleaning of the raw marketing and sales data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and patterns to inform decision-making.
- **Visualization**: Using charts and graphs to visualize data and marketing trends.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Building predictive models to assess the impact of different marketing strategies.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Advanced techniques to optimize budget allocation and forecast revenue based on marketing spend.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Order-level data and marketing information from July 2015 to June 2016, including key performance indicators (KPIs) for marketing effectiveness.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and structured data by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and transforming data into a format suitable for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed exploratory analysis to understand the trends in marketing spend and its correlation with revenue.
   - Key insights on the most impactful marketing channels.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized the performance of various marketing channels using bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines to illustrate patterns in the data.
   
5. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Built predictive models (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to assess how different marketing levers contribute to revenue.
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

6. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - Developed deep learning models to forecast revenue and optimize budget allocation.
   
7. **Optimization Recommendations**:
   - Based on the findings from the models, provided recommendations on how to streamline or reallocate the marketing budget across channels to maximize revenue.

## Key Findings

- Identified underperforming marketing channels that provide little to no ROI.
- Recommended channels where marketing spend should be increased for better revenue impact.
- Suggested opportunities for budget reduction or redistribution.
